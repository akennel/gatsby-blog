E got the license for the backup software today.  
 
Full backups work perfectly.  This is not a surprise, as they are basically  the same as running a backup from the command line.  You back up the entire Site  Collection, and can only do an all or nothing restore.  Exactly the same  capability we have now.
 
Still, I was able to test backing up a Site Collection, and then restoring  the Site Collection.  Everything worked as expected, so that’s good.
 
The item level backups are failing, however.  I’m pretty certain that  they’re failing because of the same bug that’s breaking exports.  Specifically,  this is a problem with Microsoft’s Fab 40 templates and the GUID used in some of  the documents.  I’ve put in a support call with our vendor, partly to see if they can  fix the problem, partly to see how well their support works.
 
I suspect that the fix will be to uninstall the templates.  I’ll have to  see if this will be acceptible to Dave who’s shown some interest in a few of the  templates.
