It’s a bit late to start this, seeing as how the server is already up and running, but I thought I’d keep a blog detailing my efforts in installing and configuring Sharepoint.

Currently MySites are running on port 82. I’ve gone back and forth on giving them their own URL instead, like mysites.uhsinc.biz. In the end, I stuck with a port instead. I’m not sure if it really makes a difference.
