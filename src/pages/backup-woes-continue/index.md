We installed backup software from EMC for the Sharepoint site. A full, disaster recovery type backup runs fine, but document level backups fail. 

Since then I’ve been working with EMC support to resolve the problem. (See my earlier posts).  
Today, they sent me information that seems promising. Micrsosoft seems to be aware of the issue, and has a possible fix. With any luck, we’ll be back in business soon.

Here are the details forwarded me by tech support:  
– By looking at another customer files, the issue has been narrowed down by Microsoft to one of the MHT files on SharePoint.  
– We received a possible workaround from Microsoft and provided that to the customer  
– We are waiting to receive information from that customer on the status of backups after implementing a workaround.  
– Since this does not seem to be an isolated occurrence that one of the MHT files is bad (might be an issue in your case as well), Microsoft was asked to investigate it further to understand what might be causing the MHT file to become damaged/corrupted.
