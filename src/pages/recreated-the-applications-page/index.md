I rebuilt the Applications page yet again.
This time, we’re using the Site Directory, hooray!
 
I created a new view in the Site library.  It filters out anything that  doesn’t have Application checked.  I still think we are in danger or “losing”  some Team/Department sites this way.  Our navigation is very sparse by design,  and there’s just not any place to put navigation.
 
Well.  That’s something to worry about going forward.  For now I have an  Applications page which work pretty well.  It looks nice, and you can find what  you’re looking for.
 
If all else fails, we have search.
