I had a training session today with a new employee. She is the new Admin Assistant to the #2 person in the company. It’s a rather important position, so I spent more time than I normally would on a simple training session like this. 

 
I walked her through the basics of email and calendar, with an emphasis on  the calendar, and stressed that she should call with any problems.
 
Later in the day, she did call with a list of databases she wanted access  to.  I took the opportunity in my reply to illustrate how Document and Database  links were created.  Here’s a copy of that section of my reply:
 
<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;"> </span>

<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;">You start by opening the database/document you want to link to.</span>

 <span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;"> </span>

<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;">With the database open, click Edit…Copy As…Application Link. (In earlier versions of Notes, it was called Database Link instead of Application Link, but everything else worked the same way)</span>

<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;">It will look like nothing has happened, but you now have the link in your clipboard.</span>

<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;">Next create an email message. In the body of the message click Edit…Paste (Alternately, you can right-click and select Paste from the pop-up menu. Or, you can just press Ctrl-V on the keyboard.)</span>

<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;">You’ll now see an icon like this: </span>[![](./databaselink.png)](https://turtlemafia.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/databaselink.png)<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;"> </span><span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;">The blue book icon means your link is to an application.</span>

<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;">For a document link, you do basically the same thing, except that you would first open or select a document and then click Edit…Copy As…Document Link.</span>

<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;">When you paste your link, it will look like this:</span>[![](./documentlink.png)](https://turtlemafia.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/documentlink.png)<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;"> </span><span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;"> The yellow paper icon means that your link is to a document.</span>

<span style=";font-family:Helv;font-size:85%;">There is also another type of link called a View link. This opens a specific view in an application, for example Purchases Pending Approval in a Purchase Requisition system. A view link looks like this:</span>[![](./viewlink.png)](https://turtlemafia.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/viewlink.png)
