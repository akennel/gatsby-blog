IBM has just released the latest version of Domino, 8.0.1. As a part of this release, they’re putting out a free push client for Windows Mobile devices. This is doubtless an attempt to counter Microsoft’s own push client for Exchange server.  
I’m still waiting for a download link from IBM. So, I’ve yet to play with the software, but I have a few thoughts.  
1) IBM still makes it ridiculously hard to find software downloads. Their Passport Advantage download site is a night-mare to navigate, and doesn’t remember your preferences from one visit to the next. I’ve downloaded the Korean language version of Notes too many times to mention.  
2) They’ve made this new software a separate download.[![](http://turtlemafia.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/downloadlink-300x267.png)](http://turtlemafia.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/downloadlink.png)  
They are even forcing you to sign up for the software, then wait for a download link to be emailed to you. But wait, it’s not that easy! They’ve buried the sign-up link. It took me 10 minutes to find it. Even when you find the right page, the actual link is just the word “here” which is itself obscured by a paragraph of text at the bottom of the page. As a service to anyone else trying to download this software, here is a [**Direct Link**](https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?lang=en_US&source=swg-lnt10beta)  
(Seriously, look at that screen-shot. I had to circle the link to make it visible).  
3) They’re requiring that you request licenses. Wha? The whole point of this software is that there’s no extra charge, so why are they tracking licenses?  
4) Windows Mobile is the only platform supported currently. This isn’t a big deal in the North American market with that’s the dominant non-Blackberry smart phone, but Nokia is king in Europe. Also, leaving Palm users out in the cold seems a bit odd, although I’m sure they’re getting used to it.

At my company we currently have equal numbers of Blackberry users and Windows Mobile users running on Goodlink. The Blackberry users are happy, so I don’t see any movement there. The Goodlink users, however, are generally not happy. We’ve been with Goodlink for a couple of years now. We were one of their earliest Notes shops, and helped test early releases of their product. And…we’ve never really liked Goodlink. It’s slow. It takes over the device it’s installed on to a disturbing degree. It kills battery life.  
The only reason we’ve been running it was that there was no real alternative. If Traveller is up to snuff, I have no doubt that we’ll shut down our Goodlink server within a year.
