Welcome to the new blog, I hope you enjoy your stay!

## New version of my site!

I've been running a WordPress site for years now. Still available (for now!) at [Turtle Mafia](https://turtlemafia.org)

I've set up this site as a replacement, and excuse to explore static site generators. This blog is based on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)

It's a new experience for me, but I've been doing a lot of React development at work, so it seemed a good fit.
I'll be posting various tips that I run across.
