I’m not sure how I became the graphics guy around here, but that seems to be what I am. D IM’d me today and asked for some changes to a button. Basically, he just wanted to change the text on the button from Save to Submit.  
This time around, I started with a brand new graphic file. I used my color picker tool to find the colors used on the current button. I then used GIMP to do a gradiant fill that matched the colors. (It’s very subtle, but the top of the button is brighter than the bottom) I matched the font by eye, and sized everything.  
All in all about 10 minutes work. Nothing major, but this kind of work is a fun break from my normal routine.
