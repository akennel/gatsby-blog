<div>We had a strange problem with mail routing this week.  People whose mail is on the Nashville server were unable to send mail to a particular user –  call her User A.  User A’s mail was located on corporate, but for some reason, the  Nashville server insisted that her mail file was on Nashville.  It wasn’t of  course, so delivery failed.  </div>
<div>The funny part was that no other server acted this way.  Send User A a  message on any other server and it would happily run over to corporate for  delivery.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We assumed the problem was with the Address Book on Nashville, and  eventually replaced the file with a fresh copy after various fixes failed.  The  new copy acted the same way.  What finally fixed the problem was deleting User A  altogether and creating her a new account.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Very odd.  The strangest thing to my mind, is that User A’s mail was never  at any point on the Nashville server.  I still have no idea what happened.</div>
