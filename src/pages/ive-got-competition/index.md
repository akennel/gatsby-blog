I did a search for Sharepoint Wake Up, and found this page: [http://www.codeplex.com/entmosswakeup](http://www.codeplex.com/entmosswakeup)  
Very cool.  Looks like he saw my script and decided to make his own version.  I haven't had a chance to look at his source code yet, but it will be interesting to see how he approaches the same challenge.

From his documentation it looks like he's decided to make search depth specific to each starting site, instead of using a single value for all sites.  Interesting choice.    
His logging is better than mine.  (No big surprise there, since I released 4 versions before I bothered to add logging.)  
 He also seems to have some code that looks for multiple pages within each site.  I've just been touching the default page.  I'm very interested to see how he does that.
