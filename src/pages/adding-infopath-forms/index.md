I just uploaded an Infopath form for D using what I think of as the  formal way.
 
The informal approach is very easy.  Design the form and click Publish,  then point Infopath Designer to a Form Library, or create a new one, and click  OK.  That works well enough, but is apparently not an option when the Infopath  form contains code.
 
The formal way is to logon to the Admin Site and go to Manage Form  Templates under the Application Management tab.  From there you upload a copy of  the template file.  Once uploaded, you have to activate the form for each Site  Collection that will use it.  This is also done via the Manage Form Templates  Site.
 
Once activated, you have to go to the Form Library Settings on the Form  Library you want to work with.  From there, click Advanced Settings and change  Allow management of Content Types to Yes.
That creates a new section called Content Types.   Now you just have to add  your new from from the list of existing content types.  (And in the case of a  Form Library where you want all documents to use the form, remove the  others).
Whew!  That’s quite a few steps.
 
Not sure yet if you have to repeat everything when the form changes, but  I’m guessing you just have to upload the new file version.
