<div>J asked me to create a Change Management site last week.  He’d  been using a Word document template to gather information about change requests  and record signatures.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Today I suggested we convert his Word document into an Infopath form so  that end users could fill out everything via their browser.  He agreed, so I got  to work.</div>

I’m pretty happy with the way it turned out. The Word document was fairly ugly — lots of garish colors and huge groups of picklists. I’ve changed that to a more restrained look, and used Radio buttons and drop down menus to keep the form from looking too busy. 

<div> </div>
<div>I used repeating sections to handle those cases where more than one name  needed to be entered.  On the current form, he just had a bunch of blank  lines.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also got to use Submit Options for the first time.  These let you  automatically generate a unique filename for the document instead of relying on  the user to type something in themselves.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One thing that bothers me is that we don’t have a standard look and feel to  any of our forms.  Not even a common color scheme.  I’ve been using the MS  standard shades of blue.  On this form I also added a nice faded UHS logo to the  top.  It’s an attractive, understated logo, that I think I’ll be using in future  forms.</div>
