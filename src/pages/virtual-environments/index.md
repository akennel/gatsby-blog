D has asked for a staging server. He wants a Sharepoint environment we can use to allow normal users to try out new applications before we roll them into production. It’s a good idea, and one that we talked about in the past, but never acted on.  
I don’t have any additional hardware at the moment, so I’ve created a virtual machine on the current Dev server. I’ve been a big fan of VMWare for years, but I decided to go with Microsoft’s Virtual PC for this machine. Mostly as an opportunity to familiarize myself with it.  
I’d already build out an image with Server 2k3 and MOSS installed. I’d build this image months ago for our team to use on their workstations as personal dev environments. I took that image and adapted it into a full fledged server.  
So far so good, but the performance seems much worse than I’d expected. I’ll do some tweaking, but if I can’t improve things, I’m going to have to switch back to VMWare.
