First to build my Sharepoint Warm Up tool, SPWakeUp, and then while building my CSV to Infopath migration tool.  
We recently received Visual Studio 2008 at work and I decided to upgrade. Unusually for a Microsoft product, Visual Studio lets you install the newest version without replacing the old version. This made me very happy, so I kept 2005 installed.

I use [RocketDock](http://rocketdock.com/) to manage my applications, so I immediately added VS 2008 to my bar. The new program icon is more or less identical to the old version. To make it easier to tell the two versions apart, I made this black & white icon for VS 2005.
