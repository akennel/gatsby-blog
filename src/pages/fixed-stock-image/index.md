The stock image we got from J was too small and off-center.  J  sent us a new copy of the file — but their version was too large, and the  background was the wrong color.
 
I tool the file and erased the background color to make it  transparent.  I then shrunk the icons and moved them to the bottom left corner  to make the spacing look right on the home page.
 
I’ve attached a copy of the file in my Shared Documents folder.  
 
One possible problem — IE v6 can’t handle transparent backgrounds in PNG  files.  Our standard is IE7, so this shouldn’t be a problem.  I’ve checked it in  Firefox and Opera, and they both display correctly.
