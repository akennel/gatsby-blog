<div>We’ve decided to control access to all our Sharepoint sites through Active  Directory groups.  By default every site will have 3 groups – Owners, Members,  Visitors.  These correspond roughly to Managers, Editors, Readers in  the Domino world.</div>

<div>The good news is that this will take the burden of maintaining access off  my shoulders and put it on the Help Desk.  We’ll see how popular this  proves to be as we move forward.  It will also make changes to access a wee bit  slower.  </div>

The downside is that site owners could add/remove people  themselves.  I’m sure most site owners would do a great job, but I also know  from experience that some people shouldn’t be let within 50 feet of a setting  like that.</div>
