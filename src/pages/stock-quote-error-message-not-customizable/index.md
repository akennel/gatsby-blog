M got an error message when visiting the front page.  It was very  long winded, but basically just said the stock quote web part couldn’t update  with the current price.
 
We’ve only seen the error message once, but VP asked me to check if we  could customize the error message.  
The vendor doesn’t have a support phone number.  You have to enter a help  request through their web site and they contact you via email.  I jumped through  the hoops, and arranged for a phone call.
 
Today the support person checked our settings (everything was fine), and  said, “That’s a good idea, but you can’t customize the error message.”
He’s going to put in a suggestion that the feature be added to the next  version and email me when it is ready.
 
Vendors.  They make life so interesting.
