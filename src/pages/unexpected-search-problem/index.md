So, I’ve finally gotten my Test server indexing a network share. For testing, the network team gave me an account with full access to everything on the Department shares. The initial index ran overnight for about 10 hours, which was not unexpected. Now we’ve got it running and my tests show that all is working, even PDFs.

What I’ve found is that I have access to files that are waaaaaaay too personal. (Use your imagination) I’ve also found a few financial files that should be locked down. Now I’ve always had access to these files, they’re all stored in public folders, I’ve just never had a way to find them before. I can already see that I’m going to face a challenge educating upper management: Don’t ban the tool for revealing our bad security, fix the security.
