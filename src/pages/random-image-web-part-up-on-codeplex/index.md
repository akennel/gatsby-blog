I’ve just released by Random Image web part on the Codeplex.

This is a very, very simple web part that displays a random image from a picture library every time it is refreshed.  It is based on the Smart Part web part created by Jan Tielens.



I’m uploading it mostly because I haven’t seen anything similar available for download, but also because I think it might be helpful for other people trying to figure out how to create web parts for Sharepoint.  

I’ve been having trouble finding good examples out there that clearly show how to do simple things like: Get and set a property for a web part; Access files from within a library; Pass filters to other web parts.  What I’ve tried to do with the web parts I’ve built is comment each section as clearly as I can, so that it’s obvious how each bit of code works.  

Now I mostly do this for myself because, to be honest, I’m still learning.  If I don’t comment what I’ve done, and comment it excessively, I’m liable to forget how I’ve done something.  Hopefully my example will help other people out there trying to wrap there head around the same problems.
