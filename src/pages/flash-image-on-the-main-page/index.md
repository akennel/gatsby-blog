<div>We have the Image rotator web part up and running on the main page of the  portal.  M uploaded graphic files of all the facilities.  I then  resized the web part to 535×188 which is the size of the graphic files J sent us.  The right corners are rounded off, which look bad at the  moment, but M assures me we’ll get new image files before we go live.</div>

<div>We are having a problem with the web part recognizing new images.  I’m able  to fix it by going into the the web part configuration and saving it again.   This “fix” doesn’t seem to work for M though.  We don’t have any  documentation for the web part…or even the name of the vendor!…so we’re  flying blind.</div>
