Or, I should say E fixed it. 

<div>A company was unable to reach our mail routers.  Several days after the  problem popped up, they asked me to look into it.  Thursday I worked with  someone from the company who had no access to anything, and really didn’t know much about  networking.  Friday at 4:30pm, I got a call from someone with a brain.</div>
<div>We quickly figured out that their servers were trying to send mail to the  correct servers, but couldn’t connect.  The company’s tech had seen it before and  thought our ISP was block their subnet.  I forwarded the suggestion and asked E to take a look.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Monday around noon I got an urgent call from VP asking for the status.  I  contacted E (who’d forgotten over the weekend).  He looked into it and found  that someone had made a routing change that only affected the company with the trouble.  The change was  made right when email stopped working.  Ding Ding!  E changed the setting  back, and everything is back to normal.</div>
