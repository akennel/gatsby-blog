<div>Bit of a problem with this one.  J and H both asked me  to create it last week.  I told them that VP had put a stop to new sites  until the Portal had been presented to management.  Today both J and H  came by -within about 5 minutes of each other- to say that VP had given his  blessing.</div>
<div>I created the site, and made some customizations to it – more on those  later.  A few minutes later, VP spots the new site and sends an email out  asking who created it when he told us not to create any new sites.  Sighs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I’ve let him know that both J and H claimed to have permission, so  I’m off the hook.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For the site customizations, J wanted a few changes made.  First he had  me add a calendar.  No problems.</div>
<div>Then he gave me a Word document and asked me to make it the template used  when creating new docs.  This was a bit trickier.  I opened the document in  Word, and saved it as a Word Template (.dotx).  I then clicked around the List  settings and found I needed to save the template in a hidden folder called Forms  in the list.  Once there, and advanced setting made it the default template when  creating new documents.</div>
<div>Next, I created a fairly simple approval workflow for the list.</div>
<div>Last, I set default access to Reader for the site, then change the List to  have Author access as default. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It all seems to be running the way he wants now.</div>
