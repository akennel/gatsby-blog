Another case of a secretary sending out the wrong file.  
In this case, we shut down access to the mail server for everyone. Once we had the list of people who’d received the message, we shut down access just for them, and opened it back up for everyone else.

In Domino 8, there’s a built-in feature for recalling messages. We’re still running 7, though, so we used a home-built application.
