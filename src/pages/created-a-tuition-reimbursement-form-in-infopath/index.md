This is getting easier. I’ve found it’s best to go over a print-out of the form you’re migrating first and group the information into sections. For example, in this form I had the following sections: Employee Info, Course Info, Justifications, and Approval.  
Once you have groups for each of the sections created, it’s a simple matter of filling in the necessary fields.

Since the sections roughly mirrored the layout of this form, I created 4 1×1 layout tables stacked one on top of eachother. This let me concentrate on one layout section at a time. When I got to the Course Info, I realized that I’d made my layout sections too small. Since everything was already in a table, I just had to resize the 4 layout tables and everything lined up again.

Start to finish, I had a good looking form created in about 20 minutes. This was a simple form with only 21 fields and 2 repeating sections, but I’ve found this approach scales up to very large forms as well.
